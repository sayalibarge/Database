2>which subdivision of SQL is used to insert values in tables?

->
To insert data into table you can use DML i.e data maniplation language INSERT command.

-It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways.
1.The first way specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted:

syntax : -
	
	INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
	VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

2.If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. 
However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.

 The INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:
	INSERT INTO table_name
	VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
